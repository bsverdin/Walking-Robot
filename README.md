# Walking-Robot
Walking robots for Science fair
In this repository, There are the codes for multiple robots: Model STU (initial prototype focused solely on energy-efficnecy), Model VINNIE (second prototype with a camera for easy operation), and MODEL TERRA (last prototype with a ultrasonic distance sensor).
All the walking robots operate on the Arduino IDE software system.
Model STU only uses an Arduino Uno board
Model VINNIE and MODEL TERRA uses two Espressif boards: The ESP32-CAM AI THINKER and the ESP32-WROOM
